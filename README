Turtle-Compiler
Lex and Yacc translate a made-up "turtle language" into working python code 


Building and Executing
	The project is already built.  The executable file is simply called "turtle."  But if something happens to this file, just run 
	"make" again, ensuring that all files mentioned in the makefile are in the linux directory.  This will re-build the "turtle" 
	executable.  To run the executable on a program written in turtle language, just type "./turtle < programName".  

Important Project Files
	pyturtle.y  --  yacc file, translates turtle language tokens into python code
        turtle.l    --  lex file, scans tokens from the program written in "turtle language"
	makefile    --  the makefile, builds the file 

Executable
	turtle
	(./turtle)

Sample Input Files
	smallTest       //these are all input files written in Turtle language
	bigTest
	building
	
Sample Output Files
	smallTest.py    //these files are the result of the input files being ran through the turtle executable
	bigTest.py
	building.py
